"""
Support logic layer for the family member node.

Handles role-name normalization, reading/writing the conversation history file,
responder voting (LLM call), and voice assignment. Does not depend on ROS2
communication. Called from the afs_family_member node.

The conversation state changes themselves (when to publish what, to whom) are
tied closely to locks/timers, so splitting them out risks breaking the timing;
they are therefore not included here (per the CLAUDE.md policy on what stays
in the Node).
