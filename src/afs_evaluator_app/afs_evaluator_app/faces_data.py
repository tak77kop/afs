"""
FACES-IV data definitions and parsing logic layer.

Maintains 62-item definitions and subscale groupings, and parses conversation
history and evaluation CSVs. Free of Flask dependencies (this was originally a
ROS2-independent web app). Called by app.py in afs_evaluator_app.

Items 1-42 correspond to the original 6 FACES-IV scales (2 balanced, 4 unbalanced),
43-52 to the Family Communication Scale, and 53-62 to the Family Satisfaction Scale.
`SUBSCALES` below records these groupings.

Note: The item texts in FACES_ITEMS are standard psychological assessment scale wording,
retained in their original English to preserve validity as a standardized scale.
