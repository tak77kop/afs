"""
Logic layer for the gradient descent that pulls FACES IV coordinates toward the "balanced" type.

A plain Python class with no ROS2 dependency. Given the current evaluation result
(percentiles), it updates the target subscale scores for the next session by one
gradient-descent step. Called from the afs_optimizer node.

Beginner's note: "gradient descent" here just means "take a small step in the
direction that reduces the family's imbalance score, then check we didn't step
too far." The six subscale percentiles (Balanced Cohesion, Balanced Flexibility,
Disengaged, Enmeshed, Rigid, Chaotic) are the six numbers this step adjusts.
