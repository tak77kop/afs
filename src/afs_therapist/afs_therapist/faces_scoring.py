"""
Logic layer for FACES IV (Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale) scoring.

A plain Python class with no ROS2 dependency. Takes the 62-item subjective ratings
(1-5 scale) and converts them into subscale scores -> percentiles -> circumplex
model coordinates (x, y). Called from the afs_evaluator node.
