# AFS: Agent Family System

AFS (Agent Family System) is an agent family system that aims to realize a "new family" composed of a person and robots (agents) such as father robots, mother robots, and daughter robots. By interacting with a robot family, a person feels a sense of warmth and a secure base, aiming to eventually reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness. It implements a multi-agent system that performs family-like conversations and behaviors using ROS2 and LLM. The user can intervene at any time by speaking into a microphone during the robot family's conversation. In order to make the robot family's conversation more like that of a human family, AFS adjusts the behavior of the robot family based on Olson's Circumplex Model and its evaluation scale, FACES IV. Specifically, it visualizes the current state of the robot family by plotting it on Olson's Circumplex Model, and in the case of unbalanced types, uses Gradient Descent to approach an ideal balanced type of family. These adjustments are performed by a therapist node (agent) separate from the robot family members.

This project is developed as part of the research at the **Fumihide Tanaka Laboratory** at the University of Tsukuba. Our lab mainly focuses on HRI (Human-Robot Interaction), conducting research to create intelligent agent technologies that are always by our side and help us in our lives.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Interaction**: Expresses the individuality of each family member (father, mother, daughter, etc.) using LLM. Also, synchronizes each agent's conversation using ROS2 to achieve family-like conversation.
- **FACES IV Visualization**: Real-time plotting of the current and ideal states of the robot family on the axes of "Cohesion" and "Flexibility" of Olson's Circumplex Model.
- **Physical Representation via Movement**: Integration with [toio™](https://toio.io/) robots allows robots to change the physical distance from a person by moving.
- **Interactive**: Real-time Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) using Gemini Live allow the user to intervene in the robot family's conversation.

## 🏗 System Architecture & Processing Flow

AFS operates in a closed-loop cycle where the **Therapist Node** (`afs_therapist`) leads the robot family members toward a balanced type according to Olson's Circumplex Model. **The Person (User)** can intervene in the robot family's conversation at any time to influence it.

<details>
<summary><strong>🐳 Docker Quick Start (Not Recommended / Deprecated)</strong></summary>

**The easiest way to try AFS.** No Ubuntu or ROS2 installation required — works on **Windows, Mac, and Linux** via your browser.

> [!WARNING]
> **Audio I/O Limitation**: In the Docker environment, microphone (STT) and speaker (TTS) functions only work fully on Linux hosts. On Windows / Mac, audio device passthrough is not supported, so audio features will not be available. Core features such as text-based LLM interaction and FACES IV visualization work on all platforms.

**1. Install Docker**

| Platform | Installation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ubuntu** | `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-v2` then `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` (log out & back in) |
| **Mac** | Download and install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) |
| **Windows** | Download and install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (WSL2 backend required) |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robotaichi/rfs.git afs
cd afs

# Set API keys
cp docker/.env.example .env
nano .env  # Enter OPENAI_API_KEY and GEMINI_API_KEY
```

> [!TIP]
> In the `.env` file, enter the key directly after `=` without quotes:
> ```
> OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxx
> GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaxxxxxxxx
> ```

```bash
# Build & start (first build takes ~10 min)
docker compose up --build
```

> [!NOTE]
> On Linux, you can use native audio passthrough instead:
> ```bash
> docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.linux.yml up --build
> ```

**5. Launch AFS**
- Double-click the **"AFS Launch"** icon on the desktop
- Or open a terminal and run:
  ```bash
  ros2 launch afs_bringup afs_all.launch.py
  ```

**6. Stop**
```bash
docker compose down
```

### 🔄 How to Update
To apply the latest updates from the repository to your Docker environment, run:
```bash
git pull origin main

### Bluetooth Speaker & Toio Mapping (Optional)

If you plan to place speakers on top of [toio™](https://toio.io/) robots for physical movement, you must correctly map each toio™ cube to its corresponding Bluetooth speaker. This system is designed for small Bluetooth speakers like the [ELUT EMBS-HFSASBK](https://www.amazon.co.jp/ELUT-%E3%83%8F%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BA%E3%83%95%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B9%E3%83%9E%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%82%A2%E3%82%B7%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%B9%E3%83%94%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AB%E3%83%BC-%E3%83%96%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF-EMBS-HFSASBK-%EF%BC%BBBluetooth%E5%AF%BE%E5%BF%9C%EF%BC%BD/dp/B08CDQCWV8).

1.  **Power on Toios**: Turn on all toio™ cubes (long press the power button on the back).
2.  **Speaker Pairing**: Pair all Bluetooth speakers you intend to use with your Ubuntu PC and ensure they are "Connected".
3.  **Run Mapping Script**: 
    ```bash
    cd ~/afs
    python3 src/afs_toio/afs_toio/toio_speaker_match.py
    ```
3.  **Role Assignment (Sequential)**: When you run the script, one of the speakers will announce "Speaker [Role Name]. Please place this speaker on the rotating Toio." Immediately after the announcement, the corresponding toio™ cube will rotate; place that specific speaker onto the moving toio™. As the next speaker plays its audio, repeat this process for each remaining speaker.
4.  **Save Configuration**: Once all pairs are confirmed, the IDs will be automatically saved to `config.json`.

### Configuration

Before starting AFS, you need to set a valid API key to use the LLM. To persist the settings, add them to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# 1. Open .bashrc
nano ~/.bashrc

# 2. Add these lines at the end of the file
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."

# 3. Save and reload
source ~/.bashrc
```

- [**`OPENAI_API_KEY`**](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys): Essential for LLM-based dialogue generation and psychological mapping.
- [**`GEMINI_API_KEY`**](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey): Required for Gemini Live-based audio transcription (STT) and low-latency speech generation (TTS).

2. **Launch AFS (Launch all necessary nodes at once)**:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch afs_bringup afs_all.launch.py
   ```

- **Temperature Settings**:
  - **Dialogue (`1.0`)**: A default setting of 1.0 is used for turn-taking to ensure natural, varied, and creative conversation that reflects the dynamic nature of robot family interactions. Adjust in `config.json` if necessary.
  - **Evaluation (`0.7`)**: A slightly lower 0.7 is used for psychological assessment to ensure reliable and consistent scoring while still capturing the subjective feel of the robot family members. Adjust in `config.json` if necessary.

## 📊 FACES IV & Gradient Descent

The **Therapist Node** evaluates the current state of the robot family using **FACES (Family Adaptability & Cohesion Evaluation Scales) IV**. If the robot family state is judged to be an unbalanced type, it uses **Gradient Descent** to calculate the optimal parameters to approach the balanced type, and provides feedback to the robot family members such as "Your family is in this state now, so please behave like this from the next conversation." Specifically, it calculates and plots target points so that the point on the Circumplex Model consisting of Cohesion and Flexibility approaches the center (50, 50), and gives instructions to the robot family members to carry out the next conversation based on this target point.

### Interactive Simulation

You can visually confirm how the Therapist Node steers the family state towards the Balanced Center with a simple interactive simulation.

👉 **[Launch Interactive Simulation](https://robotaichi.github.io/rfs/simulation/index.html)**

### Olson's Family Circumplex Model

The **Circumplex Model of Marital and Family Systems** (developed by David H. Olson) provides a framework for understanding family dynamics across three major dimensions: **Cohesion**, **Flexibility**, and **Communication**.

1.  **Cohesion**: The emotional bonding that couple and family members have toward one another.
2.  **Flexibility**: The amount of change in its leadership, role relationships, and relationship rules in response to situational and developmental stress.
3.  **Communication**: The third dimension in the Circumplex Model and is considered a facilitating dimension, which means that good communication helps couples and families alter their levels of cohesion and flexibility to better deal with developmental or situational demands.
    **※It is not drawn on Olson's Circumplex Model.**

The model classifies family states into **Balanced** (Healthy/Functional) and **Unbalanced** (Extreme/Dysfunctional) regions. Our Therapist Node uses this model to steer the unbalanced robot family back towards the balanced type.

![Olson's Circumplex Model](docs/images/circumplex_model.png)

### Percentile Conversion

Before any mathematical calculation or plotting on the Circumplex Model, the system converts the **Raw Scores** obtained from FACES IV assessments into **Percentile Scores**. This conversion is essential for plotting on the Circumplex Model and ensures normalized scale ($0$ to $100$).

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 Conversion Charts (click to expand)</strong></summary>

The following conversion charts, based on standard FACES IV norms, are used by the system.

</details>

### Ratio Scores

The system also calculates **Ratio Scores** to assess the family state simply. A Ratio Score greater than 1 typically indicates a healthy, balanced system, while a score less than 1 suggests an unbalanced (unhealthy) system.

These are calculated using the converted **Percentile Scores** from the charts above:

1. **Cohesion Ratio**
> [!NOTE]
> ```math
> \text{Cohesion Ratio} = \frac{C_{bal}}{(C_{dis} + C_{enm}) / 2}
> ```

2. **Flexibility Ratio**
> [!NOTE]
> ```math
> \text{Flexibility Ratio} = \frac{F_{bal}}{(F_{rig} + F_{cha}) / 2}
> ```

3. **Total Ratio**
> [!NOTE]
> ```math
> \text{Total Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cohesion Ratio} + \text{Flexibility Ratio}}{2}
> ```

### Dimension Scores

These scores are used to plot the point $(Cohesion, Flexibility)$ on the Olson Circumplex Model. They are calculated by substituting the **Percentile Scores** from the charts above into the following formulas.

1. **Cohesion Dimension Score ($x$)**
> [!NOTE]
> ```math
> x = C_{bal} + \frac{C_{enm} - C_{dis}}{2}
> ```

2. **Flexibility Dimension Score ($y$)**
> [!NOTE]
> ```math
> y = F_{bal} + \frac{F_{cha} - F_{rig}}{2}
> ```

The Dimension Scores are constrained to the following range to ensure consistent plotting:

> [!NOTE]
> ```math
> \text{Dimension Score} = \begin{cases} 5 & (\text{Score} < 5) \\ \text{Score} & (5 \le \text{Score} \le 95) \\ 95 & (\text{Score} > 95) \end{cases}
> ```

### Gradient Descent

The **Therapist Node** calculates target points by performing Gradient Descent on the robot family state vector, providing a guide for the robot family to approach the balanced type.

#### 1. State Vector ($s_t$)
The family state at turn $t$ is represented as a 7-dimensional vector consisting of the converted **Percentile Scores**:

> [!NOTE]
> ```math
> s_t = \begin{bmatrix} C_{bal} \\ C_{dis} \\ C_{enm} \\ F_{bal} \\ F_{rig} \\ F_{cha} \\ Comm \end{bmatrix} = [C_{bal}, \dots, Comm]^T
> ```

#### 2. Cost Function ($J(s_t)$)
The goal is to minimize the cost function:

> [!NOTE]
> ```math
> J(s_t) = \omega_1 \frac{U}{2B} - \omega_2 Comm_t + \frac{\omega_3}{2} \left[ (x - 50)^2 + (y - 50)^2 \right]
> ```
Where:
- $B = C_{bal} + F_{bal}$ (Balanced Sum)
- $U = C_{dis} + C_{enm} + F_{rig} + F_{cha}$ (Unbalanced Sum)
- $x, y$: Dimension Scores (see above)

#### 3. Gradient Calculation ($\nabla J(s_t)$)
The gradient vector $\nabla J(s_t)$ represents the direction of steepest increase for the cost function:

> [!NOTE]
> ```math
> \nabla J(s_t) = \left[ \frac{\partial J}{\partial C_{bal}}, \dots, \frac{\partial J}{\partial Comm} \right]^T
> ```

Individual partial derivatives are calculated as follows:

> [!NOTE]
> ```math
> \begin{aligned}
> \frac{\partial J}{\partial C_{bal}} &= - \frac{\omega_1 U}{2B^2} + \omega_3(x - 50) \\
> \frac{\partial J}{\partial F_{bal}} &= - \frac{\omega_1 U}{2B^2} + \omega_3(y - 50) \\
> \frac{\partial J}{\partial C_{enm}} &= \frac{\omega_1}{2B} + \frac{\omega_3}{2}(x - 50) \\
> \frac{\partial J}{\partial C_{dis}} &= \frac{\omega_1}{2B} - \frac{\omega_3}{2}(x - 50) \\
> \frac{\partial J}{\partial F_{cha}} &= \frac{\omega_1}{2B} + \frac{\omega_3}{2}(y - 50) \\
> \frac{\partial J}{\partial F_{rig}} &= \frac{\omega_1}{2B} - \frac{\omega_3}{2}(y - 50) \\
> \frac{\partial J}{\partial Comm} &= - \omega_2
> \end{aligned}
> ```

#### 4. Family State Update & Learning Rate
The goal state is updated iteratively:

> [!NOTE]
> ```math
> s_{t+1} = s_t - \eta(Comm_t) \cdot \nabla J(s_t)
> ```

Where the learning rate $\eta (Comm_t)$ represents the **step width**:

> [!NOTE]
> ```math
> \eta(Comm_t) = \frac{Comm_t}{100} \cdot 0.25
> ```

**0.25** is the degree to which the family type approaches the balanced type (configurable via `learning_rate_scaling` in `config.json`).

*This step width (how much to move the point) corresponds to Communication functioning as a **lubricant** to facilitate the movement of Cohesion and Flexibility.*

The resulting vector adjusts the behavior (conversation content, etc.) for individual family members, guiding the system towards the **Balanced Center (50, 50)**.
